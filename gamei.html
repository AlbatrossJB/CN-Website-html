  <p class="text">The programs you will see and learn about are:
    Z-brush
    Illustration
    and finally Photoshop
  </p>

  <div>
    <p class="text">Using Z-brush or any 3D modeling program is pretty hard to grasp, so many different techniques and ways to do one thing and it can confuse you. So keep in mind do the best of your ability
    and then continue onward and try o touch up anything up at the end or set times frames for doing certain tasks and if your not happy at the end then address them.
    Personally, what I would do is spend little time on the details until the end and spend most of the time sorting out the shape and model, because this is the bones and once your happy you can move on wihout
    regretting anything also it is easy to edit your model once the detail is done.
    </p>
   <p class="text">With Illustration, you don't need to spend a lot of time on making a sketch perfect thats what the modeling is for, the idea's are always rough but the model makes the diamond
    so sketch your image and then move forward, your time is mostly editing your model's sketch later on down the line.
    Always make sure you have a clear image in your head before drawing o sketching because if you don't, all your doing is making your own life harder and your going to end up blocking yourself down the line.
    So, go step by step and make sure your willing to put the time and effort into making your idea, pen and paper used to be the best way to make your art but since we have tech and a pen and pad we can do it 
    using our computers so easily, so if your a person doing pen to paper all your doing is making your life harder but there isn't anything wrong with that. But honestly pen to a pen pad is advised highly
    because you can have then side by side and mirror yourself using a different application and thats all I can say on Illustration.
    </p>
    <p class="text">Finally, the best till last but not required what so ever is Photoshop. This is easier to use and is better to make details on your sketch later down the line but helps making a image come to life,
    so I wouldn't personally use this but it is recommend by some experts.(Do whatever you want to do)
