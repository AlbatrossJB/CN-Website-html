        <h2 style ="text-align: left;"<p>About me</p>
        <p class = "text">Hello, my name is Johnnic Buckley and I'm he lead developer of a game in the works called Merrorem and currently doing 3d sculpting. I'm 20year old junior developer on a course at Codenation and this game is a pet project I'm making to help me advance my knowledge of game development. </p>
        <p class = "text">I'm a young man of many experiences like Coding, Joinery, Carpentry, Science, Gardening and finally 3D modeling. I love to get as much experiences as I can because it furthers myself and my capabilities of life,
            sadly tho... One drawback is my learning disability, Dyslexia. It limits me most of the time but I try to push past it. Reading and writing code is hard for me since the words look
        mixed and intertwined with each other but since I have a overlay it helps but also doesn't since the colours change and it makes me stumble since it looks different to others.  </p>
            <p class = "text">But that doesn't really matter to me, the code is where I have been living for the past couple of weeks so it has helped me understand and recognise my mistakes and errors.
                Next for me is game development, I've grew up playing games for a long time games where my life, I would spend money, hours and sacrifice my education for gaming. But then leading to my 14h birthday i realised finally that it won't help me advance in life
                so I limited my gaming and my time alone o pu everything into studying so I could pass Secondary school and move into college. After passing I went to college and studied Carpentry and Joinery for 2-3 years and dropped out in my 3rd year,
                because I found a new passion, Bartending. This helped me as a person and helped me communicate, understand others points of view and also working in a fast paced environment. I worked as a bartender for 2 years now and currently still involved with it and will alway be involved with it.
