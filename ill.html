<p class="text2">Illustrator, one of the best products that came out of Adobe. The program is just a sketching program that is widely used by a lot of successful arts and modelers, the program in our field is 
    to make our quick design for our model. So, don't spend too much time on this unless you're doing detailed work and know how you want your image to be.
</p>
<p class="text2">The program is very easy to use and get used to, so before getting to modeling spend as much time as you want getting used to the program and mess with the tools. Once you feel ok with the tools
    start to make your model in your modeling program in my case it's ZBrush.
    Make sure your sketch is too your liking and make sure you like the design because you will be using the sketch for a long time.
    I'm not the best with Illustrator bu here is a video you can watch to make up for me not being able to teach this.
